Working

At first we will start by setting up the window by using the while loop so that the window persists and when we click the close button then it should close off as doing anything in window is considered as event so this thing is done by checking events. Then we set up the logo and title. We setted up the spaceship with its coordinates by using blit. Then check for the key functions like pressing arrows and when releasing in while loop. We then set the boundaries of the game so that our spaceship should not go beyond of our window. Then set the enemy image and its coordinates. Creating the movement mechnaism of enemy. Add the background image of the game. Then settes up the logic to shoot multiple bullets. Detect for colliisions and respawning using the list structure and keep the check for the score
